        I love bringing ideas to life through clean, responsive, and
        user-friendly interfaces. Coding lets me combine creativity with logic —
        turning design concepts into interactive experiences. I enjoy solving
        problems, refining details, and collaborating to create seamless digital
        products that make people’s lives easier.
